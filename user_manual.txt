NAME
    xuproc.py - Process JUnit XML files by updating test case attributes or print test statistics.

SYNOPSIS
    python3 xuproc.py [options] [file]

DESCRIPTION
    xuproc.py processes JUnit XML files to either update the test case 'name' attributes
    by concatenating the 'classname' and 'name' attributes, or it prints the statistics
    about total tests, failures, errors, and skipped tests in the XML file.

OPTIONS
    -h
        Display this help message and exit.

    -j
        Update each test case in the XML file by concatenating the 'classname' and 'name'
        attributes in the following format:
        classname.name
        Subsequent runs will not duplicate the classname if it's already present in the name.

ARGUMENTS
    file
        Path to the JUnit XML file to process.

EXAMPLES
    Print test statistics for a JUnit XML file:
        python3 xuproc.py tests.xml

    Update the 'name' attribute of test cases with the 'classname':
        python3 xuproc.py -j tests.xml

EXIT STATUS
    0   Successful completion.
    1   An error occurred (file not found, XML parsing error, etc).
    

Key Features:

         XML Parsing: The script uses Pythonâ€™s xml.etree.ElementTree module to process the XML.
         Concatenation Handling: Ensures that the classname is concatenated only once to the name 
         attribute, even if the script is run multiple times on the same file.
         Statistics Reporting: Outputs test statistics such as total tests, failures, errors, and skipped tests.

Known Limitations (WARNING)

         The script modifies the XML file in place. If you need to preserve the original file, 
         make a copy before running the -j option.
